' PowerBasilisk Enhanced - batch 192 test
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Subject: SCROLLBAR TRACKPOS, after the batch-192 correction.
'
' What batch 192 changed
'   * A probe (2026-09-26) disproved the batch-191 note "SET/GET TRACKPOS
'     have no codegen arm":  GET TRACKPOS was implemented all along
'     (codegen arm + runtime reader over SIF_TRACKPOS).
'   * `SCROLLBAR SET TRACKPOS` is not an official form - six forms are
'     documented, none is SET TRACKPOS, the coverage CSV has no such row,
'     and Win32 SIF_TRACKPOS is read-only.  The parser now rejects it with
'       Error: SCROLLBAR SET: TRACKPOS is a GET-only sub-command on line N
'     instead of letting it fall through to a codegen "unknown statement".
'
' Batch-192 coverage note (added after v0.2.046):
'   The 23 new parser diagnostics from this batch are COMPILE-TIME REJECTIONS.
'   A runnable sample cannot assert them - anything that compiles did not hit one.
'   Their negative probes live in the repository root folder _negative_probes/
'   and are exercised by the skill script check_negative_probes.py.
'   This file therefore covers only the TRACKPOS half of batch 192.
' This sample exercises the GET side positively (it must compile and print
' FAILURES: 0).  The SET side is a compile-time rejection, so it cannot be
' asserted from inside a program; the negative probe lives in the working
' directory as _b192_probe_set_trackpos.bas.
'
' Expected output:  four "sb ..." lines and "=== FAILURES: 0 ===", exit 0
