' PowerBasilisk - batch 200 test: the 64-bit handle must reach the variable
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:   pin the batch 200e defect and its fix.  Before the fix, a handle assigned to a
'            variable never arrived: the generated code stored 8 bytes into a 4-byte slot, the
'            backend saw an out-of-bounds store and dropped it, so the variable stayed 0.
' Note:      an ImageList handle is pointer-sized (64-bit here), so the variable that holds it
'            must be QUAD - a LONG truncates it and later calls get an invalid handle.
' Asserts:   1. the handle is non-zero after IMAGELIST NEW
'            2. the handle still works: GET COUNT on it, then KILL
' Expected:  every printed value non-zero; count of a fresh list is 0 (correct).
