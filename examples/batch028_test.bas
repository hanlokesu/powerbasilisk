' PowerBasilisk Enhanced - batch 28: THREADED (thread-local storage)
' THREADED vars are global to every Sub/Function but each thread has its
' own independent copy. We verify: main sets tcount=1, a child thread sets
' its own tcount=2 and copies it to a plain global; main still reads 1.
'
' NOTE: the main thread waits with SLEEP, not a busy loop -- an optimizer
' is allowed to hoist an invariant global load out of a busy loop, so a
' DO WHILE flag=0 spin can keep reading the pre-thread value forever.
