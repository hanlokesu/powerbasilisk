' batch180_test.bas - the GRAPHIC WINDOW family (batch 180)
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:   Exercise the nine statement forms added in batch 180:
'
'   GRAPHIC WINDOW NEW      caption$, x&, y&, w&, h& [,hFont] TO hWin& [,HIDE|NORMALIZE]
'   GRAPHIC WINDOW TEXT     caption$, x&, y&, nRows&, nColumns& ... TO hWin&
'   GRAPHIC WINDOW CLICK    [hWin&] TO click&, x!, y!
'   GRAPHIC WINDOW END / HIDE / MINIMIZE / NORMALIZE / STABILIZE / NONSTABLE [hWin&]
'
' Official sources (C:\PBWin10\bin\PBWin_extracted\html):
'   GRAPHIC_WINDOW_statement.htm            (NEW / TEXT, and the persistency rule)
'   GRAPHIC_WINDOW_CLICK_statement.htm      (1 single, 2 double, 0 none, x!/y!)
'   GRAPHIC_WINDOW_{END,HIDE,MINIMIZE,NORMALIZE,STABILIZE,NONSTABLE}_statement.htm
'
' Demonstrates:
'   * NEW really creates a live top-level window in its own window class,
'     visible by default.  The help page also says the new window becomes the
'     selected graphic target when nothing else is selected, so the very next
'     GRAPHIC CLEAR must land in it without a GRAPHIC ATTACH - that is what the
'     pixel read below proves.
'   * the display is persistent.  Each window keeps its own memory DC over a
'     compatible bitmap; GRAPHIC CLEAR paints there and a real WM_PAINT (driven
'     by UpdateWindow) blits it back to the screen, which GetPixel then reads.
'     Two different colours in a row prove the paint path runs more than once.
'   * HIDE -> IsWindowVisible answers 0, NORMALIZE -> 1, MINIMIZE -> IsIconic 1,
'     NORMALIZE again -> IsIconic 0.  NORMALIZE is the documented way out of
'     both states.
'   * CLICK answers 0 with zero coordinates when nothing was clicked, 1 for a
'     single click and 2 for a double click, reports the client coordinates, and
'     consumes the click: reading it again without a new click answers 0
'     ("since the last time this statement ran").
'   * STABILIZE refuses WM_CLOSE, and NONSTABLE accepts it again.
'   * TEXT sizes the window in rows and columns.
'   * END destroys the window on demand.
'
' What this sample deliberately does NOT cover (and why):
'   * the optional [, hFont] operand of NEW/TEXT: a font handle needs
'     CreateFont, which is a separate statement family; the default-font path is
'     what the plain form uses, and that is what is checked here.
'   * real mouse input: an unattended verifier has no mouse, so the clicks are
'     delivered as the two window messages the window procedure actually
'     receives (WM_LBUTTONDOWN / WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK), which is also what makes the
'     check reproducible.
'   * the greyed system menu item of STABILIZE: WM_CLOSE being refused is the
'     stronger half of the same promise and needs no menu introspection.
'
' Expected output (run mode): a series of "ok" lines and
'   "=== FAILURES:0 ===", exit code 0.
' Complexity note: O(1) - a fixed list of window messages and pixel reads.
