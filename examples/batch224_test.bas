' batch 224 - dual-compiler example conversion witness
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' The ConPrint/ConWaitKey wrapper above compiles and runs identically on
' PowerBASIC 10 (PBWin10) and on this fork.  This witness prints two
' lines through ConPrint and waits for a key with ConWaitKey - the
' pattern every console example in examples/ now follows.
' Expected output (headless): B224-CONPRINT-1 / B224-CONPRINT-2
' Expected output (interactive): the two lines, then "waiting for any
'   key to exit..." and a keypress returns to the prompt.
