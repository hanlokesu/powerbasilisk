' PowerBasilisk Enhanced - batch 191 regression test
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:  batch 191 turned the three DDT families' *unknown sub-command*
'           fallbacks into hard compile errors.
'
'           Before it, a line such as
'               LISTVIEW  BOGUS hDlg, 401
'               TREEVIEW  BOGUS hDlg, 402
'               SCROLLBAR BOGUS FOO hDlg, 403
'           parsed into Statement::Noop: the compiler printed
'           "=== Exit code: 0 ===", produced an EXE, and the statement did
'           absolutely nothing at run time.  That is the "accepted but no
'           operation" class of defect the project treats as a bug, so the
'           fallback now prints
'               Error: LISTVIEW: unknown sub-command "BOGUS" on line N
'           and increments the parser's error count, which stops the build
'           before codegen - the same hard-fail path every other parse
'           error uses.  Verified by four throwaway sources, one per site:
'             LISTVIEW BOGUS        -> unknown sub-command "BOGUS" on line 4
'             TREEVIEW BOGUS        -> unknown sub-command "BOGUS" on line 4
'             SCROLLBAR BOGUS FOO   -> expected GET or SET, found "BOGUS" on line 4
'             SCROLLBAR GET BOGUS   -> unknown sub-command "BOGUS" on line 5
'
' What this file proves (the *positive* half of the change)
'   Every sub-command the three families really implement must still parse
'   and still work.  A hardening patch that quietly broke a good form
'   would be worse than the silence it removed, so all three families are
'   exercised here end to end.
'
' Demonstrates:
'   * LISTVIEW  INSERT COLUMN / GET HEADER / INSERT ITEM / GET COUNT /
'              SET TEXT / GET TEXT / SET USER / GET USER / SELECT /
'              UNSELECT / GET SELECT / GET STYLEXX / SET STYLEXX / RESET
'   * TREEVIEW  INSERT ITEM / GET COUNT / GET ROOT / GET CHILD /
'              GET NEXT / SET EXPANDED / GET EXPANDED / SET TEXT /
'              GET TEXT / SELECT / UNSELECT / GET SELECT / DELETE / RESET
'   * SCROLLBAR SET RANGE / GET RANGE / SET POS / GET POS /
'              SET PAGESIZE / GET PAGESIZE
'              (SET/GET TRACKPOS parse but have no codegen arm yet - see the
'               note near the end of PBMAIN; they are an open item.)
'
' Witnesses used, and one that is NOT available
'   * a second, independent observation of the same state through a
'     different statement path - e.g. INSERT ITEM moves the count and
'     GET COUNT reports the new value, so a GET COUNT that never changes
'     cannot pass.
'   * `CONTROL ADD ... TO h` must agree with `CONTROL HANDLE hDlg, id TO h2`:
'     if they disagreed, every statement below would be aimed at a
'     different control than the assertions believe.
'   * NOT available in this fork today: raw USER32 calls against the handle
'     these statements return.  GetClassNameA(hLv, ...) comes back empty and
'     SendMessageA(hLv, LVM_GETITEMCOUNT, 0, 0) comes back 0 while
'     LISTVIEW GET COUNT on the same control reports 3 - the statements are
'     right and the raw-message path is not usable here.  This was found
'     while writing this sample and is recorded as an open item, not
'     papered over: no assertion below depends on it.
'
' Expected output (run mode):
'   --- handle witnesses ---
'   (no output unless a handle is NULL or the two eidts disagree)
'   --- LISTVIEW ---
'   lv header        -> [Qty]
'   lv count         -> 3   after insert 4 -> 4
'   lv text          -> [Apricot]
'   lv user          -> 1234
'   lv sel           -> 2   after unselect -> 0
'   lv style xx      -> n   after set n -> n
'   lv count after reset -> 0
'   --- TREEVIEW ---
'   tv count         -> 3   after insert -> 4   after delete -> 3
'   tv root == root / child == A / next == B
'   tv expanded on   -> -1  off -> 0
'   tv text          -> [Renamed]
'   tv sel == hB, after unselect -> 0
'   tv count after reset -> 0
'   --- SCROLLBAR ---
'   sb range -> 0 / 100
'   sb pos -> 25   after move -> 60
'   sb pagesize -> 10
'   === FAILURES: 0 ===
'   (exit code 0)
'
' Complexity note: O(1) - a fixed control set and a fixed operand count.
'
' Notes:  the dialog is opened MODELESS and closed with DIALOG END hDlg,
'   fail, so the sample never waits for input and is safe for the
'   non-interactive verification harness.  The exit code is the number of
'   failed assertions.  Handles are AS QUAD because an item handle is a
'   real x64 pointer.
