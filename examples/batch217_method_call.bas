' PBXB64 Example - batch 217 witness: the dotted method call `o.M(args)`.
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' batch 216 gave a METHOD an implicit BYREF receiver, so
'     Box_SetIt(a, 33)
' already mutated the object.  What was still missing is the dot form a PB
' programmer actually writes:
'     a.SetIt(33)          ' statement position
'     x = a.GetIt()        ' expression position
' Before batch 217 both spellings stopped the build:
'     Codegen warning: FUNCTION PBMAIN -> Runtime error: Unknown field: C.GETIT
'     [pbcompiler] 1 codegen errors (functions skipped)
'     Error: I/O error: clang EXE link failed:
'     lld-link: error: undefined symbol: PBMAIN
' The parser built `o.GetIt` as a field access and dropped the argument list,
' so the call never reached codegen at all.  It was a loud failure - no silent
' wrong value - but a gap.
'
' What this witness pins down:
'   * `o.M(args)` lowers to the qualified procedure `<Class>_<Method>(o, args)`
'   * statement position: the call runs, the result is discarded, the object changes
'   * expression position: the method's return value is what gets assigned
'   * a real argument list after the dot: receiver first, then the written args
'   * per-object state survives the sugar (b is untouched by a's calls)
'   * `o.M(args)` and `Box_M(o, args)` are interchangeable - both are checked
' Expected output (run mode):
'   a.v after a.SetIt(33) = 33
'   b.v untouched         = 22
'   a.GetIt() / b.GetIt() = 33 / 22
'   a.SetIt(44) then GetIt = 44
'   a.Add(7)              = 51
'   long form Box_Add(a,7)= 51
'   === FAILURES:0 ===
' Complexity: O(1) - a handful of field reads, eight comparisons.
