' batch163_test.bas - DIALOG GET SIZE / DIALOG SET SIZE
' ---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:  exercise the two statements added in batch 163 and assert the
'           dialog-unit round trip that the official help describes.
' Tests:    * DIALOG GET SIZE immediately after DIALOG NEW reports the very
'             size DIALOG NEW was given.  The official help
'             (dialog_get_size.htm) says the values are in dialog units
'             unless the dialog was created with the PIXELS option; DIALOG
'             PIXELS is still unimplemented, so every dialog is a
'             dialog-unit dialog and the numbers must match exactly.
'           * DIALOG SET SIZE resizes the window, and a second
'             DIALOG GET SIZE reports exactly the new size.
' Expected output (run mode):
'   after DIALOG NEW   = 320 x 200
'   after DIALOG SET   = 500 x 360
'   PASS
' Exit code: 0 = both checks passed, 1 = a check failed.
' Notes:    DIALOG NEW shows the window right away (pb_window_new calls
'           ShowWindow), so a small window flashes while this runs.  The
'           program never enters a message loop, so it exits by itself and
'           needs no interaction.
