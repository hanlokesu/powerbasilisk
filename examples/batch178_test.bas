' batch178_test.bas - the resource-image CONTROL family
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:   Exercise the eight statements added in batch 178:
'
'   CONTROL ADD IMAGE / IMAGEX        (batch 178)  image in a STATIC
'   CONTROL ADD IMGBUTTON / IMGBUTTONX (batch 178)  image in a BUTTON
'   CONTROL SET IMAGE / IMAGEX        (batch 178)
'   CONTROL SET IMGBUTTON / IMGBUTTONX (batch 178)
'
' Official sources (C:\PBWin10\bin\PBWin_extracted\html):
'   control_add_image.htm, control_add_imagex.htm,
'   control_add_imgbutton.htm, control_add_imgbuttonx.htm,
'   control_set_image.htm, control_set_imagex.htm,
'   control_set_imgbutton.htm, control_set_imgbuttonx.htm
'
' Demonstrates:
'   * the resource-id form of image$ ("#998"); the icon this very file
'     compiles into its own EXE below is the image under test, so the sample
'     is self-contained and needs no external asset at run time
'   * the format is discovered at load time when the style does not name it:
'     the icon-first probe must end up with %SS_ICON(0x3) on the STATIC and
'     %BS_ICON(0x40) on the BUTTON, because a STATIC or BUTTON only paints an
'     image when its style says which kind it holds
'   * the X forms really differ from the plain ones: the STATIC X form adds
'     %SS_REALSIZECONTROL(0x40), the plain form must NOT carry it
'   * %WS_TABSTOP(0x10000) is the documented default primary style of an
'     image button, and it must reach the window
'   * the TO clause is optional for these ADD forms (control 105 is created
'     without it and resolved afterwards with CONTROL HANDLE)
'   * an image really is attached: %STM_SETIMAGE(0x172) / %BM_SETIMAGE(0xF7)
'     are what the runtime used, so %STM_GETIMAGE(0x173) / %BM_GETIMAGE(0xF6)
'     must hand a non-zero handle back
'   * all four SET forms run on a control of the matching format and leave
'     an image attached
'
' What this sample deliberately does NOT cover (and why):
'   * the style& / exstyle& clause: no CONTROL ADD form in this fork reads it
'     yet, the parser stops at the eight documented operands
'   * a CALL callback clause: accepted and ignored, as for every other
'     CONTROL ADD form here (control callbacks are not wired up)
'   * the "replacement must be the same format" failure path: it needs a
'     bitmap resource, and the resource embedder in this compiler only
'     handles icons today
'   * the disk-file form of image$ ("name.ico"): the automated runner
'     executes this EXE from the repository root, not from examples\,
'     so a bare file name would not resolve
'
' Expected output (run mode): a series of "ok" lines and
'   "=== FAILURES:0 ===", exit code 0.
' Complexity note: O(1) - a fixed list of window messages and style reads.
