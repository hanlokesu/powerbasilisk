' batch 201 - GLOBALMEM and TRACE: two silent no-ops made real
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Defect 1: `GLOBALMEM ALLOC 64 TO h` parsed to ONE argument, because the parser
'   only consumed TO after a comma.  The codegen arm needs two arguments, so the
'   statement compiled cleanly and then did nothing at all.
' Defect 2: the numeric branch of TRACE PRINT skipped four bytes for a length
'   prefix that is not there.  num_to_string returns a BSTR whose pointer already
'   addresses the characters, so `TRACE PRINT 42` wrote a stray byte from
'   uninitialised heap instead of 42.
'
' Pointer results (GLOBALMEM LOCK, IMPORT ADDR, IMAGELIST NEW) are 64-bit
' addresses: hold them in QUAD.  A LONG truncates them to 0 on this target.
' The trace file this program writes is checked externally by the harness:
' it must contain exactly the two lines "alpha" and "42".
