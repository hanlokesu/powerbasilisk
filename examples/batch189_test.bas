' THE COMMON-CONTROL FAMILY, PART 2 (Tier-3 DDT GUI, four statements)
'
'   CONTROL ADD TRACKBAR  hDlg, id&, x, y, w, h TO hCtl&
'   CONTROL ADD UPDOWN    hDlg, id&, x, y, w, h TO hCtl&
'   CONTROL ADD HOTKEY    hDlg, id&, x, y, w, h TO hCtl&
'   CONTROL ADD IPADDRESS hDlg, id&, x, y, w, h TO hCtl&
'
' Official sources: control_add_trackbar.htm, control_add_updown.htm,
' control_add_hotkey.htm, control_add_ipaddress.htm
' (all under C:\PBWin10\bin\PBWin_extracted\html).
'
' WHAT THIS SAMPLE WITNESSES, AND HOW
' -----------------------------------
' 1. WHICH WINDOW CLASS WAS REALLY CREATED.  Each CONTROL ADD hands back a
'    handle, and GetClassNameA must then report the common-control class:
'       TRACKBAR  msctls_trackbar32
'       UPDOWN    msctls_updown32
'       HOTKEY    msctls_hotkey32
'       IPADDRESS SysIPAddress32
'    A statement that reported success but created nothing - or created a
'    plain Button - cannot pass these four checks.
'
' 2. WHICH STYLES REALLY REACHED THE WINDOW (GetWindowLongA GWL_STYLE).
'    Every one of the four is WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE, plus WS_TABSTOP for
'    TRACKBAR / HOTKEY / IPADDRESS, TBS_AUTOTICKS for TRACKBAR and
'    UDS_SETBUDDYINT | UDS_ALIGNRIGHT for UPDOWN.
'
' 3. THAT THE CONTROL REALLY BEHAVES.  A handle plus a class name still
'    does not prove the window processes its messages, so each control is
'    driven through user32's SendMessageA and read back:
'       TBM_SETRANGE -> TBM_SETPOS -> TBM_GETPOS
'       UDM_SETPOS32 -> UDM_GETPOS32
'       HKM_SETHOTKEY -> HKM_GETHOTKEY
'       IPM_SETADDRESS -> IPM_GETADDRESS
'    Every message number used below was read out of the local
'    C:\PBWin10\WINAPI includes (the same files PowerBASIC itself uses),
'    not from memory - TBM_GETPOS is WM_USER, UDM_SETRANGE32 is WM_USER+111,
'    and so on.
'
' 4. THAT CONTROL HANDLE RESOLVES THE ID.  The TRACKBAR is found through
'    CONTROL HANDLE hDlg, 301 TO hTmp as a second route to the same window,
'    so the handles are cross-checked rather than trusted once.
'
' KNOWN LIMITATION, STATED HONESTLY
' ---------------------------------
' The official syntax prints the TO clause in brackets, but this family
' (all 28 CONTROL ADD types, not just these four) currently requires it.
' The sample therefore always passes TO, and optional-TO stays on the
' outstanding list rather than being quietly assumed to work.
'
' Run mode is headless: one line per check, ending with
' "=== FAILURES:0 ===".  The dialog is modeless because a modal one would
' need a human to dismiss it.
