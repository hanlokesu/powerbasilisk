' batch181_test.bas - the six GRAPHIC statements of batch 181
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:   Exercise every statement added in batch 181:
'
'   GRAPHIC REDRAW                          (flush a buffered target)
'   GRAPHIC SET FOCUS                       (bring the window forward, focus)
'   GRAPHIC SET LOC x&, y&                  (move the graphic window)
'   GRAPHIC SET CLIENT nWide&, nHigh&       (resize the client area)
'   GRAPHIC SET OVERLAP [NumrExpr&]         (RECT edges become inclusive)
'   GRAPHIC GET OVERLAP To OverlapVar&      (read that flag back)

'   GRAPHIC_SET_OVERLAP_statement.htm       non-zero enables, zero disables,
'                                            missing means enable; BOX (0,0)-(50,50)
'                                            then reaches 50,50 instead of 49,49
'   GRAPHIC_GET_OVERLAP_statement.htm       true (non-zero) / false (zero)
'   GRAPHIC_GET_LOC_statement.htm           used here to verify SET LOC
'
' Demonstrates:
'   * a graphic window's display is buffered, so every pixel read below is taken
'     after GRAPHIC REDRAW has pushed the buffer out - which is exactly the job
'     that statement has, and why the first block both draws and flushes.
'   * the overlap flag starts disabled - Windows' own RECT convention, where the
'     right and bottom edges of a rectangle are exclusive - and every documented
'     way of setting it (explicit zero, explicit one, missing operand).
'   * the flag really changes what reaches the pixels: the same filled box paints
'     its bottom-right corner only when overlap mode is on.  The flag is one
'     runtime-wide switch, not one per target, which is stated here rather than
'     left to be discovered.
'   * SET CLIENT round-trips through GRAPHIC GET CLIENT (which reports the
'     drawing buffer's dimensions), and drawing still works at the new size.
'   * SET LOC round-trips through GRAPHIC GET LOC, which batch 181 also had to
'     fix: it used to answer 0,0 unconditionally, which is only correct for the
'     "not a Graphic Window" case the help page describes.
'   * SET FOCUS runs without disturbing the window (the foreground state itself
'     cannot be asserted from an unattended run - Windows only grants focus to a
'     process that is already in the foreground).
'
' What this sample deliberately does NOT cover (and why):
'   * the overlap rule for LINE / POLYLINE: their endpoints are already exclusive
'     in GDI terms (LineTo does not paint its final point), so the flag is applied
'     to the RECT-based statements - BOX and ELLIPSE - which is where the help
'     page's worked example lives.  Recorded as a known limit, not a silent one.
'   * dialog-unit sizing of SET CLIENT: a DDT graphic control created from dialog
'     units would scale nWide&/nHigh& by the dialog base units; this runtime
'     treats them as pixels.
'   * the greyed-out corner of a rounded box: the optional corner operand belongs
'     to the BOX statement, not to this batch.
'
' Expected output (run mode): a series of "ok" lines and
'   "=== FAILURES:0 ===", exit code 0.
' Complexity note: O(1) - a fixed list of draws and pixel reads.
