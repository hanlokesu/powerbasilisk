' PowerBasilisk Enhanced - batch 166 regression test
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:  Two things this batch fixed or added, in one runnable file.
'
' Demonstrates:
'   * CONTROL ADD classname$ - the DDT custom-control statement, in all
'     three operand forms the official page documents.
'   * DIALOG NEW ... TO <LOCAL LONG> delivering a real handle.
'
' Why the second half matters: before batch 166 every DIALOG/CONTROL
' creation arm stored the 64-bit handle with an unconditional i64 store,
' even when the target variable was a 4-byte LOCAL LONG.  The store ran
' past the end of the alloca and the handle read back as 0, so any
' program that declared its dialog handle LOCAL got a null dialog while
' the compiler reported success.  The arms now convert the handle to the
' destination's declared type first, exactly as DIALOG GET SIZE already
' did.  Nine arms were affected.
'
' Expected output (run mode):
'   dialog hwnd   = <nonzero>
'   trackbar hwnd = <nonzero>
'   progress hwnd = <nonzero>
'   statusbar hwnd= <nonzero>
'   PASS
'   (exit code 0)
'
' Complexity note: O(1) - one dialog and three controls, no algorithm.
'
' Notes:  the dialog is opened with DIALOG SHOW MODELESS and closed with
'   DIALOG END, so the sample needs no keyboard input and is safe to run
'   in the non-interactive verification harness.
'   The class names are the documented comctl32 ones - "msctls_trackbar32",
'   "msctls_progress32", "msctls_statusbar32".  Note there is no "CLASS"
'   in these names; "MSCTLS_TRACKBAR_CLASS32" is not a real window class.
