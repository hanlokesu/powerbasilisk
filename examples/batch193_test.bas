' batch193_test.bas - batch 193: 21 silent Noop sites now hard-fail
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Batch 193 turned the last 21 silently-dropped parser sites into loud compile
' errors (14 -> 3 silent sites, the three kept on purpose: bare TYPE at module
' level, #INCLUDE, one commented-out site).
'
' A hard error cannot appear inside a compiling sample, so this file is the
' *positive control*: the statements that share those code paths - a LET, a
' module-level UDT, METRICS, CHR$ and an ImageList handle - must still compile
' and still work.  If the batch had been over-tightened, one of these breaks and
' this sample stops building, which is exactly the signal we want.
'
' Asserts: LET binds, the UDT round-trips, METRICS is positive, CHR$ works and
' the ImageList handle arrives.
