' PBXB64 Example - batch 214 witness: CLASS with a real METHOD block
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Demonstrates:
'   * METHOD Name [(params)] [AS type] ... END METHOD inside CLASS
'   * the method leaves the parser as an ordinary FUNCTION named
'     <Class>_<Method> (here Point_Twice) whose first parameter is the
'     implicit BYREF receiver added in batch 216, so the call passes the
'     object: got = Point_Twice(p, 21)
'   * END METHOD is a real block terminator and the return type is
'     honoured (before batch 214 the CLASS body was skipped line by line
'     and a METHOD body ran on to the end of the file)
' Expected output (run mode):
'   twice =42
'   === FAILURES:0 ===
