' batch164_test.bas - TOOLBAR and STATUSBAR (batch 164)
' ---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:  exercise every statement form added in batch 164 and assert
'           real behaviour, not just "it compiled".
' Tests:
'   * CONTROL ADD TOOLBAR / CONTROL ADD STATUSBAR both hand back a real
'     window handle (0 would mean the control was never created).
'   * TOOLBAR ADD BUTTON x3 + TOOLBAR ADD SEPARATOR x1 -> GET COUNT = 4.
'     The official help counts separators as items, so 4 is the documented
'     answer, not 3.
'   * TOOLBAR GET STATE on a fresh button reports %TBSTATE_ENABLED (4).
'   * TOOLBAR SET STATE with BYCMD 202 (a command id, not a position)
'     disables that button, and reading it back reports 0.
'   * TOOLBAR DELETE BUTTON by 1-based position removes one item ->
'     GET COUNT = 3.
'   * STATUSBAR SET PARTS / STATUSBAR SET TEXT run without crashing.
'     Neither statement has a documented TO target, so their return
'     values cannot be captured from PB source; they are exercised for
'     the code path, and the toolbar checks carry the assertions.
' Expected output (run mode):
'   toolbar handle  = 1 (non-zero)
'   statusbar handle= 1 (non-zero)
'   count after adds= 4
'   state item 1    = 4
'   state cmd 202   = 0 (after disable)
'   count after del = 3
'   PASS
' Exit code: 0 = every check passed, 1 = at least one check failed.
' Notes:    The x/y/width/height operands of CONTROL ADD TOOLBAR and
'           CONTROL ADD STATUSBAR are parsed but ignored, exactly as the
'           official help states - both controls dock themselves inside
'           the parent according to their %CCS_* style bits.  The window
'           is shown by DIALOG NEW and never enters a message loop, so
'           this sample finishes on its own with no interaction.
