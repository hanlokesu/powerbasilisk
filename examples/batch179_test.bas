' batch179_test.bas - the last three CONTROL statements, plus the
'                      two-operand GRAPHIC ATTACH they exposed
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:   Exercise the three statements added in batch 179:
'
'   CONTROL ADD GRAPHIC  (batch 179)  a STATIC the program draws into
'   CONTROL ADD HEADER   (batch 179)  a free-standing SysHeader32 control
'   CONTROL SET COLOR    (batch 179)  per-control text / background colour
'
' Official sources (C:\PBWin10\bin\PBWin_extracted\html):
'   control_add_graphic.htm, CONTROL_ADD_HEADER_statement.htm,
'   control_set_color.htm
'
' Demonstrates:
'   * CONTROL ADD GRAPHIC really creates a STATIC, and its documented
'     default style is %WS_CHILD | %WS_VISIBLE | %SS_OWNERDRAW(0x0B) -
'     the low five style bits are the %SS_TYPEMASK, so 11 there is the
'     proof that the owner-draw default reached the window
'   * a style the program supplies REPLACES that default (control 202 is
'     built with %WS_BORDER|%SS_NOTIFY and must carry neither the
'     owner-draw default nor any other %SS_ type bit)
'   * CONTROL ADD HEADER really creates the common control whose class
'     is SysHeader32, with the documented %WS_CHILD | %WS_VISIBLE default,
'     and %HDM_GETITEMCOUNT(0x1200) answers 0 for a fresh header - the
'     window is live, not just created
'   * CONTROL SET COLOR answers the %WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC(0x0138) question
'     the parent receives when a control paints.  The three documented
'     colour values are all checked by sending that message by hand and
'     reading the brush back:
'         backclr& >= 0   a solid brush         -> differs from the
'                                                  un-coloured answer
'         backclr& = -2&  no background painted -> %NULL_BRUSH (stock
'                                                  object 5)
'         backclr& = -1&  the default again     -> the answer returns to
'                                                  the un-coloured one
'   * the documented follow-up works: CONTROL REDRAW after SET COLOR
'     leaves the control's geometry alone
'   * the two-operand GRAPHIC ATTACH form (fixed in batch 179 - the id
'     operand used to be parsed and then dropped, so it attached to
'     nothing) really puts the control's own DC behind the GRAPHIC
'     statements: what GRAPHIC CLEAR paints is what GetPixel reads back
'   * attaching a second control after GRAPHIC DETACH works too, which
'     is the re-attach path (ReleaseDC, then GetDC on the new window)
'
' What this sample deliberately does NOT cover (and why):
'   * the CALL callback clause: accepted and ignored, as for every other
'     CONTROL ADD form in this fork (control callbacks are not wired up)
'   * colouring the text of a standard push button: control_set_color.htm
'     says outright that a standard push button cannot be coloured this
'     way, so there is nothing here to assert
'   * item text in the header: the header's Txt$ is stored but never
'     painted, and the sample leaves the item list empty on purpose
'   * the DIB-section family on a control target: GRAPHIC GET BITS /
'     SET PIXEL / GET PIXEL still require a memory bitmap and decline
'     when the target is a control (documented behaviour)
'
' Expected output (run mode): a series of "ok" lines and
'   "=== FAILURES:0 ===", exit code 0.
' Complexity note: O(1) - a fixed list of window messages and style reads.
