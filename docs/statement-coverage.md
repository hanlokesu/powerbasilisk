# PowerBasilisk Enhanced — Official Statement Coverage Matrix

> **Last updated from batch 167 (v0.2.024)** — 2026-09-24. All statements through batch 167 are reflected in this matrix.

Ground truth: **PowerBASIC official documentation** (MIT license, 735 keywords / 1282 topic pages, PB/Win 10+11 / PB/CC 6+7).

> **Status-column key**: `Implemented` = this branch generates real code. `Established` = a keyword that is *mature in the official PB documentation* - it is **NOT** a claim that upstream benstopics/powerbasilisk implemented it. `Not implemented` = an official keyword this fork does not implement yet. `FORK EXTENSION` = implemented by this fork but **not** an official PB keyword. This matrix does not publish a count of upstream's own keyword set.

- Rows in this matrix: **858** (10 BLOCK, 254 FUNCTION, 5 OPERATOR, 587 STATEMENT, 2 FORK EXTENSION).
- **692** official keywords currently available (✅ Implemented by this fork + ✅ Established in the official PB docs).
- **0** documented keywords still not implemented; **164** Tier-3 DDT GUI items deferred; **2** fork extension (implemented here, not an official PB keyword).

## Summary
